Kumo
=========

Kumo is a game created part of my dissertation project. This is a short, story based game feature stat-raising mechanics. The game portrays the life of someone with common mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. This was part of my study to see whether a game was able to reduce stigma surrounding mental illnesses.
